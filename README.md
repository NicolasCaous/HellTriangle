# HellTriangle

Given a triangle of numbers, find the maximum total from top to bottom.

Example:

6 <br/>
3 5 <br/>
9 7 1 <br/>
4 6 8 4

In this triangle the maximum total is: 

6 + 5 + 7 + 8 = 26

An element can only be summed with one of the two nearest elements in the next row.

For example: The element 3 in the 2nd row can only be summed with 9 and 7, but not with 1 Your code will receive an (multidimensional) array as input.

The triangle from above would be:

example = [[6],[3,5],[9,7,1],[4,6,8,4]]

## How to Run

Just execute ```python main.py [[input]]``` inside the project

Example: ```python main.py [[6],[3,5],[9,7,1],[4,6,8,4]]```
